## 2. Guide for Requesters (Hiring Managers)

As a Requester or Hiring Manager, your two primary interactions with the system are **initiating a new hiring request** and **reviewing shortlisted candidates**. This guide covers both.

### 2.1. How to Submit a New Requisition

This is the first step in any hiring process.

1.  **Open the Form:** Navigate to the official **[Manpower Requisition Form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/jZbRTrDti4)**. We recommend bookmarking this link for easy access.
2.  **Fill in Details:** Complete all fields accurately. The more detail you provide, the faster and more accurately HR can source candidates. Key fields include the **Job Title**, **Business Unit**, **Grade**, and a clear **Justification** for the new role.
3.  **Attach Documents (Optional):** If you have a detailed Job Description or other relevant documents, please attach them using the "Upload file" button.
4.  **Submit:** Click the **Submit** button.

> **What Happens Next?**
> That's it! Your part is done for now. The system will automatically log your request, assign it a unique **Requisition ID** (e.g., `MPR-EC-024`), and route it for the necessary VP/EVP approvals. You will receive automated email and Teams notifications as your request moves through the key stages.

### 2.2. How to Review and Shortlist CVs

Once the HR team has sourced candidates, you will be asked to provide your feedback directly within Microsoft Teams.

1.  **Receive the "CVs Ready for Review" Digest:** On a daily or bi-daily basis, if there are new candidates for your review, the system will send you a single, consolidated "digest" card in a private chat from the "Power Automate" bot.

    *(Insert screenshot of the digest card showing a candidate's details)*

2.  **Review the AI-Powered Summary:** For each candidate listed, you will see key information that our AI engine has extracted, such as their current role, years of experience, and a confidence score. This is designed to give you a quick, at-a-glance summary.
3.  **Take Action:** For each candidate, you have three options:
    *   **View Full CV:** Click this button to open the candidate's original CV in a new tab for a detailed review.
    *   **✔️ Shortlist:** If you believe the candidate is a good fit for an interview, click this button.
    *   **❌ Reject:** If the candidate is not suitable, click this button. This will reveal a small text box. **Please provide a brief, clear reason for the rejection.** This is crucial for our records and for providing respectful feedback. Click "Confirm Rejection" to submit.

> **What Happens Next?**
> The system instantly records your decision. Shortlisted candidates are moved to the next stage, and the HR Representative is notified to begin scheduling interviews. You will be kept informed as those interviews are scheduled.

> **⭐ IMPORTANT: "First Click Counts" and the Digest Lifecycle**
> The system is designed to be robust and prevent accidental duplicate actions. It will only record the **very first decision** you make for each candidate on a given card.
> 
> - **The candidate will remain visible on the card** even after you have clicked "Shortlist" or "Reject." This is normal and expected.
> - If you accidentally click a button a second time for the same candidate, the system will simply send you a quick confirmation message stating that your initial action has already been recorded.
> - A **new, updated digest card** will be sent to you on the next schedule (e.g., the next day). This new card will *only* contain candidates that are still awaiting your review.

### 2.3. How to Track the Status of Your Requisitions and Candidates

You have a personalized, on-demand dashboard to view the real-time status of all your active requisitions and candidates.

1.  **Navigate to the Dashboard:** Open the **[Hiring Manager Dashboard](link-to-your-sharepoint-page)**.
2.  **View Your Items:** This page is automatically filtered to show **only the items relevant to you**. You will see a list of your open requisitions and all the candidates currently in the pipeline for those roles.
3.  **Check the Status Columns:** The `Status` column for an MPR will tell you its overall state (e.g., `CV Sourcing`, `Hiring Complete`). The `Overall Status` for a candidate will tell you their specific stage (e.g., `Interview Process Ongoing`, `Offer Extended`).

### 2.4. What to Do if Your Initial Candidates are Rejected

It is a normal part of the recruitment process for an initial batch of candidates to not meet the requirements. The system is designed to handle this "re-sourcing" cycle seamlessly.

-   **Your Role:** If you have rejected all candidates, your primary responsibility is to provide clear and actionable feedback to the assigned **HR Representative** on why the profiles were not a good fit. This can be done via email or a direct Teams chat.
-   **The System's Role:** You do not need to take any action within the system itself. The HR Representative will use your feedback to source a new batch of candidates. When they are ready, you will simply receive a **new "CVs Ready for Your Review" digest card** in Teams with the new profiles, and the review process will begin again.

## 3. Guide for Approvers (VP / EVP)

Your role is to provide timely strategic approval for new positions. The system is designed to make this process fast and straightforward, allowing you to approve from either Microsoft Teams or your email.

### 3.1. How to Approve or Reject a Request

1.  **Receive the Approval Request:** You will receive a notification in two places simultaneously:
    *   An email with the subject "New MPR Approval Request..."
    *   A message from the "Power Automate" bot in your Teams chat or the "Approvals" app.

    *(Insert screenshot of the Approval request card as it appears in Teams or Outlook)*

2.  **Review Key Details:** The request card will contain all the critical information needed to make a decision: Job Title, Grade, Number of Positions, Requester, and Justification.
3.  **View the Full Request (Optional):** A direct link to the full request item in SharePoint is provided if you need to view more detailed information or any attached documents.
4.  **Make Your Decision:**
    *   Click the **Approve** button to authorize the position.
    *   Click the **Reject** button to deny the request.
5.  **Add Comments:** You have the option to add comments to provide context for your decision. **Comments are mandatory if you reject a request.** This is a critical step for providing feedback to the requester.
6.  **Submit:** Click the "Submit" or "Confirm" button to finalize your decision.

> **What Happens Next?**
> The system instantly records your response. If you approve, the request will either be sent to the next approver (if required) or its status will be updated to "MPR Approved," triggering the HR assignment process. The original requester is notified automatically of the outcome and your comments.

## 4. Guide for the HR Manager

As the HR Manager, you are the strategic owner of the recruitment pipeline. Your primary interactions with the system involve **assigning new requisitions** to your team and **acting as the first point of escalation** for any process delays.

### 4.1. The HR Recruitment Hub: Your Central Workspace

The **"Integrated HR Recruitment Tracker" Microsoft Teams site** is your new central hub. All the data and tools you need are available as tabs at the top of the main channel.

*(Insert a screenshot of the Teams channel showing the tabs for MPR Tracker, Candidate Tracker, etc.)*

*   **MPR Tracker Tab:** This is your master view of every hiring request in the company. You can see its current status, who it's assigned to, and all related details, including real-time KPI data.
*   **Candidate Tracker Tab:** This is the master list of all candidates currently in the active pipeline.

### 4.2. How to Assign a New Requisition

Your most important automated task is assigning a newly approved MPR to an HR Representative. The system makes this incredibly simple.

1.  **Receive the "Action Required" Card:** As soon as an MPR is fully approved by management, you will receive an interactive card in a private chat from the "Power Automate" bot in Microsoft Teams. This card is your signal that a new requisition needs your attention.

    *(Insert screenshot of the HR Manager's assignment card, showing the MPR details and the dropdown menu)*

2.  **Review the Request:** The card will display the key details of the approved MPR. You can click the "View Requisition" button to open the full item in SharePoint if you need more context.
3.  **Assign a Representative:**
    *   Click the dropdown menu on the card. This list is automatically populated with your team of HR Representatives from our central `Configuration` list.
    *   Select the person you wish to assign to this requisition.
4.  **Submit:** Click the **"Assign Representative"** button.

> **What Happens Next?**
> The moment you click "Assign," the system takes over completely:
> 1.  It updates the MPR in the tracker, formally assigning the selected HR Rep.
> 2.  It calculates and sets the **SLA Target Date for Sourcing**.
> 3.  It automatically creates the entire, standardized folder structure for this MPR in the "CV Intake" document library.
> 4.  It sends a detailed "kickoff" email to the assigned HR Rep, notifying them of their new assignment and providing a direct link to the folder where they need to upload CVs.
>
> Your task is complete in a single click.

### 4.3. Handling SLA Escalations

The system is designed to proactively monitor for delays. If a process step (like Sourcing or Interview Scheduling) is significantly overdue, you will automatically receive an **SLA Breach Escalation** notification via email and Teams. This allows you to follow up and resolve the bottleneck, ensuring the hiring process keeps moving.

### 4.4. Your Role as a System Administrator

As the HR Manager, you are also the primary business owner of the system. This gives you the ability to manage key business rules directly, without needing technical assistance.

**How to Update an Approver (e.g., a New VP)**

If a key approver changes, you can update the system in seconds.

1.  **Navigate to the `Configuration` List:** In your Teams channel, click on the **"Configuration"** tab.
2.  **Find the Role:** Locate the item whose `Title` corresponds to the role you need to update (e.g., "TTE EC VP").
3.  **Edit the Item:** Select the item and click "Edit."
4.  **Change the Person:** In the `Account` field, remove the old person's name and use the people picker to search for and select the new person.
5.  **Save.**

> **What Happens Next?** The change is instant. The very next time a requisition for TTE EC is submitted, the approval request will automatically be routed to the new VP you selected.

**How to Update an SLA**

If a business decision is made to change a Service Level Agreement (SLA), you can also update this directly.

1.  **Navigate to the `Configuration` List.**
2.  **Find the SLA Rule:** Locate the item whose `Title` corresponds to the SLA you need to change (e.g., "SLA - Sourcing Days").
3.  **Edit the Item:** Select the item and click "Edit."
4.  **Change the Value:** Update the number in the `Value` field to the new number of business days for the SLA.
5.  **Save.**

> **What Happens Next?** The automated "SLA Guardian" flow will use this new value on its very next daily run, automatically adjusting its warnings and escalations to match the new business rule.

## 5. Guide for the HR Representative

As the HR Representative, you are the primary operator of the system, managing the entire candidate journey from sourcing to hiring. This guide will walk you through your key daily tasks. Your main workspace is the `HR Recruitment Hub` Teams site and its associated SharePoint lists.

### 5.1. The "Control Panel": Understanding the `Candidate Tracker`

The **`Candidate Tracker`** list is your primary workspace. Mastering two key columns will give you full control over the automation.

*(Insert a screenshot of the Candidate Tracker SharePoint list, highlighting the "Overall Status" and "Next Action (Trigger)" columns)*

*   **`Overall Status`:** This is the candidate's current, real-time position in the hiring funnel (e.g., `Pending HM Review`, `Shortlisted`, `Interview Process Ongoing`). This is mostly updated automatically by the system as tasks are completed. **You will also change this manually to kick off certain processes.**
*   **`Next Action (Trigger)`:** **This is your command center.** This dropdown field is how you tell the automation to perform specific, complex tasks for you, like scheduling an interview.

### 5.2. The Candidate Lifecycle: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Step 1: AI-Powered CV Ingestion**
1.  **Receive Assignment:** You will get a notification when a new MPR is assigned to you, which will include a link to the **"1. New CVs (Drop Files Here)"** folder.
2.  **Upload CVs:** Simply drag and drop all sourced CVs (PDF or DOCX) into this folder.
3.  **AI Processing:** The system's AI engine will automatically process each CV, create a new record in the `Candidate Tracker`, extract over 20 data points, and set the `Overall Status` to **`Pending HR Review`**.
4.  **Review AI's Work:** Go to the `Candidate Tracker` and review the new entries. Manually correct any data the AI may have misinterpreted.

#### **Step 2: Sending Candidates for Hiring Manager Review**
1.  **Initiate Review:** When you are ready for the Hiring Manager to review a candidate, simply edit the candidate's item and change their **`Overall Status`** from `Pending HR Review` to **`Pending HM Review`**.
2.  **System Takes Over:** A scheduled flow will automatically send an interactive "digest" card to the Hiring Manager in Teams. You will be notified when they have made their decision (`Shortlisted` or `Rejected`).

#### **Step 3: Scheduling an Interview**
When a candidate's `Overall Status` is **`Shortlisted`**, your next task is to schedule the interview.

1.  **Gather Details:** First, coordinate with the candidate and the interview panel to find a suitable time slot.
2.  **Go to the `Candidate Tracker`** and find the candidate's record.
3.  **Fill in the Scheduling Fields:**
    *   **`Next Interview Title`:** Give the interview a clear name (e.g., "Round 1 - Technical Interview").
    *   **`Next Interview Start Time` & `End Time`:** Select the agreed-upon dates and times.
    *   **`Interview Panel`:** Use the people picker to select all internal employees who will be on the panel.
4.  **Give the Command:** Now, go to the **`Next Action (Trigger)`** column and select **`Schedule Next Interview`**.
5.  Click **Save**.

> **What Happens Next?** The system does everything else: sends calendar invites to the panel and candidate, creates a log in the `Interview Schedule` list, sets the feedback SLA, updates the candidate's status to `Interview Process Ongoing`, and finally, **resets the `Next Action` field**, ready for your next command.

#### **Step 4: Finalizing Interview Feedback**
After an interview, the system automatically requests and collects feedback. Once all feedback is in for a round, you will receive a notification. Your job is to make the final call.

1.  **Review Feedback:** Navigate to the `Interview Schedule` list and review the feedback entries related to your candidate.
2.  **Make the Final Decision:** Go to the one feedback record (e.g., the Hiring Manager's) that you consider the definitive decision for that round.
3.  **Give the Command:** Edit that **`Interview Feedback`** item and check the box for **`Treat as Final Feedback`**.
4.  Click **Save**.

> **What Happens Next?** This single checkbox action tells the system what to do next:
> - **If the final feedback was positive** (e.g., "Recommend to Proceed"), the system updates the candidate's `Overall Status` to **`HR Selection`** and proactively sets the SLA target date for the next stage: Offer Release.
> - **If the feedback was negative** ("Do Not Proceed"), the system updates the candidate's `Overall Status` to **`Rejected`**.
> - **If the feedback indicates another round is needed**, it sets the `Status` to `Interview Round Concluded` and sets a new `TargetSchedulingDate`, putting the candidate back into the scheduling loop.

#### **Step 5: Requesting Offer Approval**
When a candidate's `Overall Status` is **`HR Selection`**, you can proceed with the offer.

1.  **Prepare Offer:** Prepare the provisional offer letter document.
2.  **Go to the `Candidate Tracker`** and find the candidate's record.
3.  **Attach the Document:** Attach the prepared offer letter directly to the SharePoint list item.
4.  **Give the Command:** Go to the **`Next Action (Trigger)`** column and select **`Request Offer Approval`**.
5.  Click **Save**.

> **What Happens Next?** The system initiates a formal approval process. It finds the correct VP/EVP, sends them an approval request with all the candidate's details and a link to the item (where they can view the attached offer), and waits for their decision. You will be notified of the outcome (`Offer Approved` or `Offer Rejected`).

## 6. Guide for the Interview Panel

As a member of the Interview Panel, you play a crucial role in assessing our candidates. Your timely and detailed feedback is essential for us to make informed hiring decisions. The system is designed to make this process as simple as possible for you.

Your entire interaction with the system happens through your **email inbox**.

### 6.1. Receiving the Interview Invitation

1.  **Calendar Invitation:** You will receive a standard calendar invitation for the interview from the assigned HR Representative's calendar. This will include the candidate's name, the position they are interviewing for, and a Microsoft Teams meeting link. Please accept or decline this invitation as you would for any other meeting.

### 6.2. How to Submit Your Interview Feedback

The system is designed to ask for your feedback at the most relevant time: **immediately after the interview is scheduled to have concluded.**

1.  **Receive the Feedback Request Email:** Shortly after the interview's scheduled end time, you will receive an automated email with a subject line like: **"[REQUIRED]: Feedback for interview with [Candidate Name]"**.

    *(Insert a screenshot of the feedback request email, highlighting the unique link)*

2.  **Open the Feedback Form:** Click the unique, personalized link in the email. This will open the "Interview Feedback Form" in your web browser.
    *   **Note:** The form will already be pre-filled with the candidate's name and other details. You do not need to enter this information.

3.  **Complete the Form:** Please provide a thorough and honest assessment of the candidate based on the questions provided. The form is structured to capture your evaluation across several key competencies.

4.  **Provide a Clear Recommendation:** The most critical field is **"Your Recommendation."** Please select one of the provided options (e.g., `Strongly Recommend to Proceed`, `Do Not Proceed`). This is the primary data point HR will use to determine the next steps.

5.  **Submit:** Once you are finished, click **Submit**.

> **What Happens Next?**
> That's it! Your part is complete. The system instantly and confidentially logs your feedback against the interview record. It then checks if all other panel members have also submitted their feedback. Once all feedback is in, the system will automatically notify the HR Representative that the candidate is ready for a final decision. Your timely submission is what keeps the entire hiring process moving forward.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This section provides answers to common questions and solutions to potential issues.

#### **For All Users:**

**Q: I submitted a request/action, but nothing has happened yet.**
**A:** Please allow up to 5 minutes for the system to process your request. The automations are fast, but not always instantaneous. If a significant amount of time has passed and you have not received a confirmation, please contact the assigned HR Representative or the System Administrator.

**Q: The system sent an approval or notification to the wrong person.**
**A:** The system's routing logic is based on our central `Configuration` list. Please contact the **HR Manager** or **System Administrator**. They can correct the configuration list immediately without any technical changes to the automation itself.

**Q: A flow run has failed, what should I do?**
**A:** Please do not attempt to "Resubmit" the flow yourself. Take a screenshot of the error message if possible and contact the **System Administrator**. Provide them with the **Requisition ID** or **Candidate ID**, and the approximate time of the failure. They will investigate and resolve the issue.

#### **For Hiring Managers:**

**Q: I clicked "Shortlist" on a candidate in my Teams digest card, but they are still on the list. Did it work?**
**A:** Yes, it worked. The system is designed to record only your **first click** to prevent errors. It will send you a confirmation message, and the candidate will be removed from the *next* digest card that is sent to you.

**Q: I need to change something on a requisition I already submitted.**
**A:** Please contact the assigned **HR Representative**. They have "Edit" access to the MPR and Candidate trackers and can make the necessary corrections for you.

#### **For HR Representatives:**

**Q: I selected an action from the "Next Action (Trigger)" dropdown, but the flow failed.**
**A:** This is almost always because a required data field was not filled out *before* selecting the action. For example, if you select "Schedule Next Interview" but have not yet filled in the `Next Interview Start Time` and `Interview Panel` fields, the flow will fail. Please ensure all necessary data is present, set the "Next Action" field back to blank, save the item, and then try again.

**Q: The AI-extracted data from a CV has a mistake.**
**A:** The AI engine is powerful but not perfect. If you notice an error in the extracted data, please **manually correct it** directly in the `Candidate Tracker` list item before proceeding with the next steps. This ensures our database remains accurate.

**Q: I uploaded a CV to the "New CVs" folder, but a candidate record was not created.**
**A:** First, allow 5-10 minutes for the AI engine to process. If it still doesn't appear, the file may have failed processing. Check the **`5. Processing Failed`** subfolder within that requisition's workspace. If the file is there, it means an error occurred. Please notify the **System Administrator** and provide them with the file so they can investigate.

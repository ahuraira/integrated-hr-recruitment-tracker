# Manpower Requisition (MPR) & Recruitment Tracking System

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the structure and workflow for the new end-to-end Manpower Requisition (MPR) and Recruitment Tracking system built in Smartsheet. This system will serve as the single, centralized platform for initiating, approving, and tracking the entire lifecycle of a hiring requestâ€”from initial concept to the proposed offer letter.

The primary goals are:
*   To provide VPs and EVPs with a single-sheet view of the real-time status of every active requisition.
*   To standardize the process from requisition initiation to final candidate approval.
*   To create clear accountability and automate status updates at each stage.
*   To establish a foundation for robust, data-driven recruitment analytics.

## 2. End-to-End Recruitment Workflow

The system is designed to manage the entire recruitment pipeline. The `Status` of a requisition will automatically update as it progresses through the following key milestones.

    end

## 3. Data Structure: Sheet Columns

The Manpower Requisition sheet is structured to capture all necessary information for the entire process.

### A. Initial Request Details (Filled by Requester via Form)
| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Unit** | The business unit for the request (`TTE EC`, `TTE FM`, `TTE PS`). |
| **Job Title** | The official title for the position. |
| **Hiring Type** | The nature of the hire: `Project/Site-Based` or `Operational`. |
| **Project/ Site** | *Conditional:* The specific project name, shown only if 'Project/Site-Based'. |
| **Grade** | The proposed grade for the role (`10` - `19`). |
| **Number of Positions**| The total number of people to be hired for this role. |
| **Proposed Date of Joining**| The target start date for the new hire(s). |

| **Created (Date)** | The date the request form was submitted, captured automatically. |
| **Created By** | The user who submitted the form, captured automatically. |

| **EVP Approval Date** | The date the EVP provided their decision, captured automatically. |

## 4. User Access & Permissions

To ensure data integrity and proper governance, user access to the sheet will be strictly defined by role.

| Role | Access Level | Permissions & Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HR Team** | **Admin** | - Can view and edit all fields. <br>- Manages workflows and automation. <br>- Updates candidate-related stages (`CV Sourcing`, `Interview`, etc.). <br>- Initiates all approval requests. |
| **EVP / VPs** | **Editor (Approver)** | - Can view the entire sheet to monitor all requisitions. <br>- Cannot edit fields directly. <br>- Can **only** interact via Approval Requests sent to them. |
| **Dept. Heads / Managers** | **Viewer (via Report)** | - **Do not** get direct access to the master sheet. <br>- Will receive a filtered **Report** showing only the requisitions for their specific Business Unit. <br>- Can submit new MPRs via the Smartsheet Form. |

## 5. Future Enhancements

This system represents Phase 1 of our recruitment process digitization. In future phases, the tracking capabilities will be extended to include post-acceptance stages, such as:
*   Final Offer Letter issuance and tracking.
*   Visa and onboarding process management.
*   Confirmation of the employee's final Date of Joining.

This phased approach ensures a smooth rollout while building towards a fully comprehensive HR management tool.
